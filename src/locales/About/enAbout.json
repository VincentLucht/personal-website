  "about": "About Me",
  "p1": "I'm a full stack engineer in Berlin, who enjoys programming and creating complex web applications that are both feature rich and responsive.",
  "p2": "I didn't know what to do after school, and I've always been curious about how coding can create amazing apps out of 0's and 1's. After searching around for courses, I kept seeing The Odin Project recommended, so I gave it a try. What started as curiosity quickly became a passion and since then, I'm hooked on programming.",
  "p3": "When I'm not coding, I'm most likely doing one of the big 3's: playing Video Games, playing the Piano, or at the gym. ðŸŽ® ðŸŽ¹ ðŸ’ª"
